# Gender-Classifier
Hello everyone !!! 
<br>This repository is a complete guide on how to build an Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of humans as 'male' or 'female'.
<br>Here are the details of this repo :

## Dataset
I got the dataset for this project from the Kaggle website.
<br>Here's the link to download the zip file : https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

## Implementation
I have used Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook for implementation. You too can download the Anaconda Navigator for your OS for free from the official website.
<br>After you are done with the installation, run the foloowing commands into the Anaconda Prompt first, before you move on to code : 
<br>pip install tensorflow
<br>pip install keras
<br>You can now launch the Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator and open a new notebook from the same directory you extracted the dataset into.
<br>You can then refer my code that I have uploaded in this repo. I have got an accuracy of 96.4% on the training set and 96.8% on the test set.
<br>I suggest you to reduce the number of epochs while you are training the code, to say 20 epochs, to save your time. Or, you can write a piece of code to stop the training once it reaches an accuracy of 95% on the test set. You can refer the "callback" section of this repo.
<br>I also suggest you take up the "Machine Learning A-Z" course on the Udemy platform to understand the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks and how they work, if you are new to Deep Learning.
<br>Thank you
